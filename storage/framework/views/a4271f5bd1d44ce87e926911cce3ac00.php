            <p>While he was a “Yogeswaraeswara” he spoke & taught his disciples on a wide range of subjects and various aspects of life & beyond impacting several souls. His discourses not only helped several souls evoking the desire for moksha but also speeding them towards it.</p>
            <p>He was a great patriot which is evident from his various discourses where he expressed his love for this great country & its Sanatana Dharma.  From amongst his several one of the pearls of the wisdom that he shared was that one should think & work for the nation when eyes are open and when they are closed think about oneself.</p>
