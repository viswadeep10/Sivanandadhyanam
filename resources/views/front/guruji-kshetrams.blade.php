            <h6>Guruji Kshetrams</h6>
            <h2>1. Bheemili</h2>
            <p>Guruvugaru post his retirement from Government service went to Bheemili and settled there. He named it Anandavanam. Kashi is also known as Ananda vanam. Both Kashi Vishwanath temple and Anandavanam Bheemili are on the same longitude of 83 degrees east. Several disciples of Guruvugaru also stayed along with Guruvugaru from 1985 onwards in Bheemili. Guruvugaru used to meet the seekers and general public after his daily pooja & abhishekam.</p>
            <p>Guruvugaru has said that Anandavanam is a place for redemption. The soul gets redeemed when the three gunas of Satva, Rajas & Tamas are in equilibrium. Staying and doing sadhana along with worship of the below dieties in the kshethram helps the soul in achieving equilibrium and thereby redemption.</p>
            <h3>Yoga Ganapathy:</h3>
            <p>Guruvugaru set up a temple of Yoga Ganapathy powered by paramaguru. This is permanent sthan of paramaguru. The yoga Ganapathy here has to be worshipped to protect ones sadhana and for guidance.</p>
            <h3>Sakshi Ganapathy Temple:</h3>
            <p>In this temple, Ganapathy is a witness and scans the soul of the seeker. He recommends to the other presiding diety to fulfil the wishes of the seeker and gradually makes him eligible for redemption by removing various desires.</p>
            <h3>Adyadi Mahalakshmi:</h3>
            <p>The main deity of the temple is Maha Shakti represented through Maha Lakshmi. The journey of the seeker to the sanctum sanctorum of the temple is after seeking blessings from Dasa Mahavidyas  and Sapta Matrikas.</p>
            <p>Guruvgaru established this temple here to make the east coast as prosperous as the west coast. The Maha Lakshmi not only provides for the material gains of the people residing in this part of the country but also in their spiritual progress.</p>
            <p>Apart from temples there is a Dhayana mandiram which the seekers can utilise for their spiritual progress.</p>
            <h2>2. Warangal</h2>
            <p>Guruvugaru came to Warangal in the year 1950 to pursue a government job in the Police department. He was in service upto the year 1982.</p>
            <p>Guruvugaru made Warangal his home and stayed here for over three decades. He used to say that Warangal is a place where Kakatiyas ruled with Desa Bhakthi and Shiva Bhakthi.  Guruvgaru’s residence in Warangal is called Gurudham.</p>
            <p>The samadhi of Guruvugaru is in Warangal.</p>
            <p>Apart from Gurudham, there is Sapthadham complex in the same location. This is a spiritual center where seekers can seek blessings from various Maharshis, Gurus & gods.</p>
            <h2>3. Jageswar</h2>
            <p>Jageswar located in Kumaon range of Almora district, Uttarakhand. Here there is a temple complex which is a very ancient with main dieties of Maha Mruthyunjaya and Pushti maata. It is the place where Maha Mruthyumjaya mantram was first heard by maharshis. There is also Vridha Jageswar closer to this place where Parvati mata performed her tapas to marry lord Shiva.</p>
            <p>Guruji informed that there used to be a maha yogi here in Jageswar who had several disciples. Guruvugaru recognised the place and shared its history with the current residents & poojaris of the temple. The Kumaon range is also known as residence of lord Subramnaya. It is believed that he is seen moving in the deodhar forests of Kumaon.</p>
